Subject: [PATCH 18/52] cli: Add message for user before modifying
 brick-multiplex option

Users should ne notified that brick-multiplexing feature is
supported only for container workloads (CNS/CRS). It should also be
made known to users that it is advisable to either have all volumes
in stopped state or have no bricks running before modifying the
"brick-multiplex" option. This commit makes sure these messages
are displayed to the user before brick-multiplexing is enabled or
disabled.

Label: DOWNSTREAM ONLY
