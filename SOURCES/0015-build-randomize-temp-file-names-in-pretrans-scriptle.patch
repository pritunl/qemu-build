Subject: [PATCH 15/52] build: randomize temp file names in pretrans scriptlets

Security issue CVE-2015-1795 mentions about possibility of file name
spoof attack for the %pretrans server scriptlet.
Since %pretrans scriptlets are executed only for server builds, we can
use os.tmpname() to randomize temporary file names for all %pretrans
scriptlets using this mechanism.

Label: DOWNSTREAM ONLY
